# Lab 006 - Logs

In this lab we are simply going to browse the default audit logs generated by Azure.

### Task 1: Visit Azure Audit Logs
In the navigation on the left, click on `All services`. Type `audit` in the search bar of this page and the only result should be `Monitor`. 

Browse around and view the Activity Log page. Here you will find all of the activities that happened in our Azure subscription today. 

Apply some filters and view logs generated from your own user. 

### Bonus
Create an Alert for your NGINX server that sends an email after CPU usage averages greater than .1

It will look something like this:

![Alert](../images/create-alert.png?raw=true "Alert")

# CLEANUP

We need to destroy our Azure Resource Group using the following command:
```
az group delete --name <your_last_name-moto-2019>
```
